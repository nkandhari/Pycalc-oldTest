# Pycalc
Python calculator for github workshop

7 Apr 2022: Within ATOM, I've accessed Pycalc after cloning it in the terminal.

Edit pycalc.py

`git status`

Before adding/committing anything, do:

`git diff`

This shows difference in latest file and the previous version of the file.

To check file specific changes in case you have changed multiple files:

`git diff README.md`

`git diff pycalc.py`

Check all previous versions of file:
`git log`
